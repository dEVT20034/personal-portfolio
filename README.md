This is my personal portfolio that highlights my skills and projects using HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript. The portfolio has various sections like my bio, projects, and contact information all contained in a dynamic design with visual appeal. Most prominently displayed on the homepage is an image of me as a software engineering intern; other notable features are social media icons which are interactive for easy access to various platforms. In the projects section one can see works like To-Do List app where users are well authenticated when logging into their accounts; another example is a cancer prediction model that has an accuracy rate of 93%. Additionally, it contains responsive contact form powered by Formspree for seamless communications including feedback to this siteâ€™s administrator. It also utilizes a particles.js background giving it a modern look. All these creates a representation of my technical expertise together with personal branding tool.
